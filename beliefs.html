                <h2>The Bible</h2>
                <p>We believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God, written by men as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. It is our only rule of faith and practice, containing all things necessary for salvation and godly living.</p>
                <p><em>"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."</em> - 2 Timothy 3:16-17</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>God</h2>
                <p>We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, yet there is but one God.</p>
                <p><em>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</em> - Matthew 28:19</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Jesus Christ</h2>
                <p>We believe Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, fully God and fully man. He lived a sinless life, died on the cross for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day. He ascended to heaven and will return again.</p>
                <p><em>"For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."</em> - 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Salvation</h2>
                <p>We believe salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. It includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faith:</strong> Believing in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior</li>
                    <li><strong>Repentance:</strong> Turning away from sin and toward God</li>
                    <li><strong>Confession:</strong> Acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God</li>
                    <li><strong>Baptism:</strong> Immersion in water for the forgiveness of sins</li>
                    <li><strong>Faithful Living:</strong> Continuing to walk with God</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>"Then Peter said to them, 'Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'"</em> - Acts 2:38</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Church</h2>
                <p>We believe the church is the body of Christ, composed of all who have been saved by grace through faith. The church exists to worship God, build up believers, and reach the lost with the gospel.</p>
                <p>We strive to follow the New Testament pattern for church organization and worship, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weekly observance of the Lord's Supper</li>
                    <li>A cappella singing in worship</li>
                    <li>Prayer and Bible study</li>
                    <li>Giving as we have been prospered</li>
                    <li>Preaching and teaching of God's Word</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>"And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers."</em> - Acts 2:42</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Christian Living</h2>
                <p>We believe Christians are called to live holy lives, following the example of Jesus Christ. This includes loving God and our neighbors, growing in spiritual maturity, and serving others in the name of Christ.</p>
                <p><em>"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new."</em> - 2 Corinthians 5:17</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Eternal Life</h2>
                <p>We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost - those who are saved to eternal life with God, and those who are lost to eternal separation from God. We look forward to the return of Jesus Christ and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.</p>
                <p><em>"And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life."</em> - 1 John 5:11-12</p>
